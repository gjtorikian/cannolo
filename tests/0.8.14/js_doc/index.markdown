JavaScript&reg; (sometimes shortened to JS) is a lightweight, object-oriented language, most known as the scripting language for web pages, but used in many non-browser environments as well. For more information on the constructs of the language, see [this article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/About_JavaScript).

This section is dedicated to the JavaScript language itselfâ€”the parts that are not specific to Web pages or other host environments.
